# Real-Time Audio-to-Text Transcription Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of real-time audio-to-text transcription in the ChatAI component. The implementation uses the Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) to provide real-time transcription of speech as the user speaks, enhancing the user experience by showing the transcription in real-time rather than only after the recording is complete.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Web Speech API Integration

The implementation leverages the Web Speech API, which is natively supported in most modern browsers. This API provides real-time speech recognition capabilities without requiring server-side processing for each audio chunk.

Key components:
- `SpeechRecognition` interface for capturing and recognizing speech
- Real-time results through the `onresult` event handler
- Proper event handling for errors and recognition end

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### Enhanced SpeechRecognition Configuration

```javascript
recognition.value.continuous = true;
recognition.value.interimResults = true;
recognition.value.lang = 'es-ES';
```

- `continuous: true` - Allows continuous recognition
- `interimResults: true` - Provides partial results as they become available
- `lang: 'es-ES'` - Sets Spanish as the default language

#### Real-Time Result Handling

```javascript
recognition.value.onresult = (event: SpeechRecognitionEvent) => {
    // Get the latest result
    const resultIndex = event.results.length - 1;
    const transcript = event.results[resultIndex][0].transcript;
    
    // Update the prompt with the transcribed text
    localAIPrompt.value = transcript;
    emit('update:aiPrompt', localAIPrompt.value);
    
    // Don't auto-send until recording is stopped
    // This allows the user to see the transcription in real-time
};
```

#### Improved Recording Toggle

The `toggleRecording` function was modified to use SpeechRecognition when available, with a fallback to the original MediaRecorder implementation:

```javascript
async function toggleRecording() {
    if (isRecording.value) {
        if (recognition.value) {
            stopSpeechRecognition();
        } else {
            stopRecording();
        }
    } else {
        if (recognition.value) {
            // Use Web Speech API for real-time transcription
            await startSpeechRecognition();
        } else {
            // Fallback to MediaRecorder if Speech Recognition is not available
            await startRecording();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Enhanced User Interface

The textarea was modified to be readonly instead of disabled during recording, allowing users to see the transcription as it happens:

```html
<textarea v-model="localAIPrompt" rows="3" placeholder="Describe la interfaz que deseas crear..."
    class="w-full px-3 py-2 border rounded-md resize-none dark:bg-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 dark:text-white"
    :disabled="localIsProcessingAI" 
    :readonly="isRecording"
    :class="{'bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-600': isRecording}"
    @input="onInput"></textarea>
```

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

The implementation includes a fallback to the original MediaRecorder-based approach if the Web Speech API is not available in the browser. This ensures compatibility across different browsers and devices.

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can see their speech being transcribed in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
2. **Reduced Latency**: No need to wait for the entire recording to be processed before seeing results.
3. **Better Accuracy**: Users can stop and correct if they notice transcription errors.
4. **Reduced Server Load**: The Web Speech API handles transcription in the browser, reducing server-side processing.

## Browser Compatibility

The Web Speech API is supported in most modern browsers:
- Chrome (desktop and mobile)
- Edge
- Safari (desktop and mobile)
- Firefox

For browsers that don't support the Web Speech API, the implementation falls back to the original MediaRecorder approach.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Adding support for more languages
2. Implementing a confidence threshold for transcription accuracy
3. Adding visual indicators for transcription confidence
4. Implementing a way to correct transcription errors in real-time
