# Testing Guide for Code Viewer Enhancements

This guide outlines the testing process for the enhanced Code Viewer functionality, focusing on the two main new features:
1. Automatic code correction
2. Complete project download with real architecture

## 1. Testing Automatic Code Correction

### Test Case 1: Flutter Code Verification and Correction
1. Open the Code Viewer with Flutter code
2. Click the "Verify Code" button
3. If issues are found:
   - Verify that a red notification appears with the message about issues
   - Verify that an "Apply corrections" button appears
   - Click the "Apply corrections" button
   - Verify that the code is updated with the corrected version
   - Verify that a green notification appears confirming the correction
4. If no issues are found:
   - Verify that a green notification appears confirming the code is valid

### Test Case 2: Angular Code Verification
1. Open the Code Viewer with Angular code
2. Click the "Verify Code" button
3. Verify that the verification process completes
4. Verify that the appropriate notification appears

### Test Case 3: Code Correction and Download
1. Open the Code Viewer with Flutter code that has issues
2. Verify the code and apply corrections
3. Click the "Download" button
4. Verify that the downloaded code contains the corrections

### Expected Results
- The verification process should correctly identify issues in the code
- The correction process should generate improved code that follows best practices
- The "Apply corrections" button should only appear when corrections are available
- After applying corrections, the code display should update to show the corrected code
- The corrected code should be used for all subsequent operations (display, download, etc.)

## 2. Testing Complete Project Download

### Test Case 1: Flutter Project Download
1. Open the Code Viewer with Flutter code
2. Go to the "Download" tab
3. Select "Complete project with instructions"
4. Click the "Download" button
5. Extract the downloaded ZIP file
6. Verify the project structure contains:
   - Full folder structure (lib, android, ios, web, assets, test)
   - Configuration files (pubspec.yaml, analysis_options.yaml, .gitignore)
   - Platform-specific files
   - Model and service classes
   - Test files
   - README with instructions

### Test Case 2: Angular Project Download
1. Open the Code Viewer with Angular code
2. Go to the "Download" tab
3. Select "Complete project with instructions"
4. Click the "Download" button
5. Extract the downloaded ZIP file
6. Verify the project structure contains:
   - Full folder structure (src/app/components, services, models, etc.)
   - Configuration files (package.json, angular.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore)
   - Basic application files (index.html, main.ts, styles.scss)
   - Environment configuration
   - Model and service classes
   - README with instructions

### Test Case 3: Instructions File
1. Download a complete project (Flutter or Angular)
2. Verify that an instructions file is downloaded
3. Verify that the instructions file contains:
   - Prerequisites for running the project
   - Steps to install dependencies and run the application
   - Project structure explanation
   - Additional commands for building and testing

### Expected Results
- The ZIP file should contain a complete project structure with all necessary files and folders
- The project should follow the standard architecture for the selected framework
- The instructions file should provide clear and accurate guidance for using the project
- The project should be runnable after following the instructions

## 3. Integration Testing

### Test Case 1: End-to-End Workflow
1. Open the Code Viewer with code that has issues
2. Verify and apply corrections
3. Go to the "Download" tab
4. Select "Complete project with instructions"
5. Download the project
6. Verify that the downloaded project contains the corrected code
7. Follow the instructions to run the project
8. Verify that the project runs correctly

### Expected Results
- The entire workflow from verification to download and execution should work seamlessly
- The corrected code should be properly integrated into the complete project structure
- The project should be functional and follow best practices

## 4. Edge Cases

### Test Case 1: Large Code Base
1. Open the Code Viewer with a large code base
2. Verify that the verification process completes in a reasonable time
3. Apply corrections if needed
4. Download the complete project
5. Verify that all code is included in the project

### Test Case 2: Multiple Screens/Components
1. Open the Code Viewer with code containing multiple screens/components
2. Use the screen selector to view different screens
3. Verify and apply corrections
4. Download the complete project
5. Verify that all screens/components are included in the project

### Expected Results
- The system should handle large code bases efficiently
- All screens/components should be properly included in the project
- The verification and correction process should work for all screens/components

## Conclusion

These test cases cover the main functionality of the enhanced Code Viewer. By following this testing guide, you can ensure that the automatic code correction and complete project download features work as expected.

If any issues are found during testing, they should be documented and addressed before releasing the features to users.
