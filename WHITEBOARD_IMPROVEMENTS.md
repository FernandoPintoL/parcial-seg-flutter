# Whiteboard Improvements

## Issues Addressed

This update addresses two main issues with the whiteboard functionality:

1. **Angular Browser Content Size**: The Angular "browser-content" appeared too small, making it difficult to see components correctly.
2. **Element Movement**: Elements could not be moved correctly in any of the whiteboards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Angular Browser Content Size Fix

The Angular browser frame was missing proper styling to define its dimensions. The following styles were added:

```css
/* Angular Web Frame */
.web-frame {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100%;
    min-height: 700px;
}

.browser-window {
    width: 800px;
    height: 600px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ffffff 0%, #f5f5f5 100%);
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 
        0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
        0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    margin: 20px auto;
}

.browser-content {
    flex: 1;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    overflow: auto;
    position: relative;
    min-height: 500px;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

These styles ensure that:
- The browser frame has a minimum height of 700px
- The browser window has specific dimensions (800px × 600px)
- The browser content has a minimum height of 500px and proper padding

### 2. Element Movement Fix

Several improvements were made to the drag-and-drop functionality:

#### a. Enhanced Mouse Movement Handling

The `handleMouseMove` function was improved to:
- Account for scroll position
- Detect the correct container based on the framework (Angular vs Flutter)
- Calculate proper boundaries with margins
- Set z-index during dragging to ensure elements stay on top
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smoother performance

```javascript
function handleMouseMove(event: MouseEvent) {
    if (!isDragging.value || !props.isEditable) return;

    // Get the canvas container and its scroll position
    const canvas = document.querySelector('.canvas-container');
    if (!canvas) return;
    
    const canvasRect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    const scrollLeft = canvas.scrollLeft;
    const scrollTop = canvas.scrollTop;
    
    // Calculate new position based on mouse movement, accounting for scroll
    const newPosition = {
        x: Math.max(0, event.clientX - canvasRect.left - dragOffset.value.x + scrollLeft),
        y: Math.max(0, event.clientY - canvasRect.top - dragOffset.value.y + scrollTop),
    };

    // Framework-specific container detection and boundary calculations
    // ...
}
```

#### b. Improved Drag Initialization

The `handleMouseDown` function was enhanced to:
- Set proper drag state
- Calculate accurate drag offset
- Set high z-index during dragging
- Add a visual class for dragging state

#### c. Better Drag Completion

The `handleMouseUp` function was fixed to:
- Check dragging state before updating
- Reset z-index properly
- Clean up visual states
- Ensure smooth transition back to normal state

#### d. Enhanced Visual Feedback

CSS for the dragging state was improved:
```css
.unified-widget-element.is-dragging {
    cursor: grabbing;
    transform: scale(1.03);
    box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    z-index: 1001 !important;
    transition: none !important;
    border: 2px solid rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.8);
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5));
    will-change: transform, left, top;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Angular Browser Content Size

1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Select the Angular framework
3. Verify that the browser frame is large enough to comfortably view components
4. Add some Angular components to the canvas
5. Confirm that the components are visible and properly sized

### Testing Element Movement

1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Test dragging elements in the Flutter framework:
   - Add Flutter widgets to the canvas
   - Click and drag widgets to different positions
   - Verify that widgets move smoothly and stay where placed
   - Check that widgets can be moved to all areas of the canvas

3. Test dragging elements in the Angular framework:
   - Add Angular components to the canvas
   - Click and drag components to different positions
   - Verify that components move smoothly and stay where placed
   - Check that components can be moved to all areas of the browser content

4. Test dragging elements in the Universal (both) framework:
   - Add widgets to the canvas
   - Click and drag widgets to different positions
   - Verify that widgets move smoothly and stay where placed

5. Test edge cases:
   - Drag elements near the edges of the canvas
   - Drag elements when the canvas is scrolled
   - Drag elements of different sizes
   - Drag elements quickly and slowly

## Responsive Testing

Test the improvements on different screen sizes:
- Desktop (1920×1080)
- Laptop (1366×768)
- Tablet (768×1024)
- Mobile (375×667)

Verify that both the browser content size and element movement work correctly on all screen sizes.
