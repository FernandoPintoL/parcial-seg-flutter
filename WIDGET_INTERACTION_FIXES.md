# Widget Interaction Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix two issues in the whiteboard application:

1. **Widget Selection to Show Properties**: Ensuring that when a widget is clicked, its properties are displayed in the properties panel.
2. **Widget Dragging Persistence**: Fixing issues where widgets would return to their original position after being dragged or "jump" when dragging starts.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Widget Selection to Show Properties

The widget selection functionality was already correctly implemented in the codebase:

- In `UnifiedWidgetRenderer.vue`, the `handleElementClick` function emits a 'select' event with the element when a widget is clicked.
- In `UnifiedCanvas.vue`, the `selectElement` function receives this event, sets the selected element ID, and emits a 'select-element' event to the parent component.
- In `PizarraUnificada.vue`, the `selectElement` function receives this event, sets the selected element, and shows the properties panel by setting `showPropertiesPanel.value = true`.
- The `PizarraPropertiesPanel` component receives the selected element as a prop and displays its properties.

This flow ensures that when a widget is clicked, its properties are displayed in the properties panel.

### 2. Widget Dragging Persistence

We identified and fixed two issues in the widget dragging implementation:

#### Issue 1: Position not preserved after dragging

- In `UnifiedWidgetRenderer.vue`, the `handleMouseUp` function was updated to include the current position in the final update.
- Previously, the function only updated the z-index of the element, which caused the position update from `handleMouseMove` to be lost.
- The fix ensures that the position is preserved after dragging by explicitly including it in the final update.

**Before:**
```javascript
const updatedElement = {
    ...props.element,
    zIndex: Math.max(props.element.zIndex || 1, 100)
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const updatedElement = {
    ...props.element,
    position: props.element.position, // Preserve the current position
    zIndex: Math.max(props.element.zIndex || 1, 100)
};
```

#### Issue 2: Widget "jumping" when dragging starts

- In `UnifiedWidgetRenderer.vue`, the drag offset calculation in `handleMouseDown` was incorrect, causing widgets to "jump" when dragging started.
- The original calculation determined the offset as the difference between the element's position and the canvas's position, not accounting for where the mouse was clicked within the element.
- The fix calculates the offset as the difference between the mouse position and the element's top-left corner, maintaining that offset throughout the drag.

**Before:**
```javascript
// Calcular offset relativo al canvas (como en el ejemplo)
dragOffset.value = {
    x: elementRect.left - canvasRect.left,
    y: elementRect.top - canvasRect.top,
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Calcular offset relativo al punto de clic dentro del elemento
dragOffset.value = {
    x: event.clientX - elementRect.left,
    y: event.clientY - elementRect.top,
};
```

This change ensures that the widget moves smoothly with the mouse, maintaining the same relative position between the mouse cursor and the widget throughout the drag operation.

## Testing

An improved test script (`test_widget_interaction.js`) was created to verify that both issues are fixed:

1. **Widget Selection Test**: Clicks a widget and checks if it's selected and if the properties panel is visible.
2. **Widget Dragging Test**: Simulates dragging a widget from its center to a new position and verifies that:
   - The widget moves to the expected position
   - The position change matches the mouse movement (within a small tolerance)
   - The position is maintained after the drag ends

The test script provides detailed logging of the drag process, including:
- Initial widget position
- Canvas boundaries
- Click position (center of widget)
- Drag destination
- Expected vs. actual position changes

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that:
1. When a user clicks on a widget, its properties are displayed in the properties panel.
2. When a user drags a widget:
   - The widget moves smoothly with the mouse cursor
   - The widget maintains its position relative to the mouse during dragging
   - The widget's position is preserved after the drag ends

These improvements significantly enhance the user experience by making the whiteboard application more intuitive and responsive, providing a natural and predictable drag-and-drop behavior that users expect.
