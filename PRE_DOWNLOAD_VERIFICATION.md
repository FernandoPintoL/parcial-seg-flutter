# Pre-Download Code Verification

## Overview

The Code Viewer component has been enhanced with automatic code verification before download. This feature ensures that users always download code that is correctly structured and follows best practices for the selected framework.

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Verification Before Download**: Code is automatically verified before download to ensure it's correctly structured and follows best practices.
2. **Progress Tracking**: Users can see the verification progress, including which files are being verified.
3. **Detailed Results**: After verification, users can see detailed results for each file, including any issues found.
4. **Automatic Correction**: If issues are found, the system automatically generates corrected code that can be applied with one click.
5. **Framework-Specific Verification**: Verification is tailored to the specific framework (Angular or Flutter).

## How It Works

### Verification Process

1. When a user clicks the "Download" button, the system automatically starts the verification process.
2. The system extracts individual files from the project code based on the framework:
   - For Angular: Components, modules, routing files, etc.
   - For Flutter: Main file, screen classes, widgets, etc.
3. Each file is verified using AI to ensure it follows best practices and is compatible with the latest framework version:
   - Angular code is verified for compatibility with Angular 15.0.0 and TypeScript 4.8.0
   - Flutter code is verified for compatibility with Flutter 3.0.0 and Dart 2.17.0
4. The system tracks the verification progress and shows which file is currently being verified.
5. After verification, the system shows a summary of the results and detailed results for each file.

### Handling Verification Results

- **If all files are valid**: The download proceeds automatically with the original code.
- **If issues are found**: The system shows a message indicating that issues were found and provides an option to apply corrections.
- **When corrections are applied**: The corrected code is used for download, ensuring that users always download code that works correctly.

## User Interface

### Verification Progress

During verification, users see:
- A spinner animation indicating that verification is in progress
- The current number of files verified out of the total
- The name of the file currently being verified
- A progress bar showing the percentage of files verified

### Verification Results

After verification, users see:
- A summary of the verification results (success or issues found)
- A list of verification results for each file, including:
  - The file path
  - Whether the file is valid or has issues
  - A message describing the verification result
- If issues are found, an "Apply Corrections" button to automatically fix the issues

## Testing the Feature

To test the pre-download verification feature:

1. **Generate Code**:
   - Create a project with multiple screens/components
   - Click the "Code Viewer" button to generate code

2. **Test Verification Before Download**:
   - Go to the "Download" tab
   - Select either "Single File" or "Complete Project"
   - Click the "Download" button
   - Observe the verification progress
   - Review the verification results

3. **Test Applying Corrections**:
   - If issues are found, click the "Apply Corrections" button
   - Verify that the code display updates to show the corrected code
   - Click the "Download" button again
   - Verify that the download uses the corrected code

4. **Test Different Frameworks**:
   - Switch between Angular and Flutter
   - Generate code for each framework
   - Verify that the verification process works correctly for both frameworks

## Technical Implementation

The pre-download verification feature is implemented across several components:

1. **WidgetParserService**:
   - `correctAngularCode`: Verifies and corrects Angular code
   - `correctFlutterCode`: Verifies and corrects Flutter code
   - `extractFilesFromProject`: Extracts individual files from project code
   - `verifyProjectFiles`: Verifies all files in a project

2. **AIService**:
   - `correctAngularCode`: Delegates to WidgetParserService
   - `correctFlutterCode`: Delegates to WidgetParserService
   - `extractFilesFromProject`: Delegates to WidgetParserService
   - `verifyProjectFiles`: Delegates to WidgetParserService
   - `verifyProjectBeforeDownload`: Convenience method that extracts files and verifies them in one step

3. **CodeViewerModal**:
   - `verifyProjectBeforeDownload`: Calls AIService.verifyProjectBeforeDownload and handles the results
   - `downloadCode`: Calls verifyProjectBeforeDownload before initiating download
   - UI elements for showing verification progress and results

4. **PizarraUnificadaCore**:
   - `handleCodeDownload`: Updated to accept and use verified code

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users no longer need to manually verify code before download.
2. **Higher Code Quality**: All downloaded code is automatically verified and corrected if needed.
3. **Reduced Errors**: Users are less likely to encounter compilation errors when using the downloaded code.
4. **Framework Compatibility**: Code is verified to be compatible with the latest framework versions.
5. **Detailed Feedback**: Users receive detailed feedback about any issues found in their code.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the pre-download verification feature:

1. **More Detailed Analysis**: Provide more detailed analysis of code issues, including specific suggestions for improvements.
2. **Support for Additional Frameworks**: Extend verification to support more frameworks (React, Vue, etc.).
3. **Custom Verification Rules**: Allow users to specify custom verification rules based on their project requirements.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the verification process for faster results, especially for large projects.
5. **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate verification with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
