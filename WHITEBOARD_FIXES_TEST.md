# Whiteboard Fixes Test Document

This document provides test cases to verify that the fixes for the whiteboard functionality work correctly.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Properties Panel Not Showing Selected Element Details**
   - Fixed by updating UnifiedPropertiesPanel to properly handle the availableWidgets prop

2. **Elements Stacking on Top of Each Other**
   - Fixed by implementing improved positioning for new elements
   - Fixed by enhancing z-index management to maintain proper stacking order

3. **Elements Not Moving Independently**
   - Fixed by modifying the handleMouseUp function to maintain element z-index after dragging

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Properties Panel Shows Selected Element Details

**Steps:**
1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Add a widget to the canvas (e.g., a Button or Text widget)
3. Click on the widget to select it
4. Verify that the properties panel shows the details of the selected widget

**Expected Result:**
- The properties panel should display the properties of the selected widget
- You should be able to edit the properties and see the changes reflected in the widget

### Test Case 2: Elements Are Properly Positioned Without Overlapping

**Steps:**
1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Add multiple widgets to the canvas (at least 5-6 widgets)
3. Verify that the widgets are positioned in a grid-like pattern
4. Verify that the widgets do not overlap each other

**Expected Result:**
- Widgets should be positioned in a grid-like pattern
- Widgets should not overlap each other
- Each new widget should be placed in an available space

### Test Case 3: Elements Can Be Moved Independently

**Steps:**
1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Add multiple widgets to the canvas (at least 3-4 widgets)
3. Select and drag one widget to a new position
4. Verify that the widget maintains its position after being moved
5. Verify that the widget remains visible (not hidden behind other widgets)
6. Repeat steps 3-5 with other widgets

**Expected Result:**
- Widgets should be movable independently
- Widgets should maintain their position after being moved
- Widgets should remain visible after being moved (not hidden behind other widgets)
- The z-index ordering should be maintained after dragging

### Test Case 4: Selected Elements Appear on Top

**Steps:**
1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Add multiple widgets to the canvas (at least 3-4 widgets)
3. Click on a widget that is partially hidden behind another widget
4. Verify that the selected widget appears on top of other widgets

**Expected Result:**
- The selected widget should appear on top of other widgets
- The z-index of the selected widget should be higher than other widgets

## Troubleshooting

If any of the tests fail, check the following:

1. **Properties Panel Not Showing Details:**
   - Verify that the UnifiedPropertiesPanel component is receiving the correct props
   - Check the browser console for any errors related to the properties panel

2. **Elements Still Overlapping:**
   - Check the calculateOptimalPosition function in PizarraUnificada.vue
   - Verify that the grid spacing and element size calculations are correct

3. **Elements Not Moving Independently:**
   - Check the handleMouseMove and handleMouseUp functions in UnifiedWidgetRenderer.vue
   - Verify that the z-index is not being reset after dragging

## Additional Notes

- The fixes have been implemented with minimal changes to the existing codebase
- The changes maintain compatibility with the existing event flow and component structure
- The fixes should work for both Flutter and Angular widgets
